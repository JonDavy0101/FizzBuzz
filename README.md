# FizzBuzz
My take of the classic game. Type in a number, and the computer will start counting up to the number you chose. For every number divisible by 3, it will say "Fizz" instead of the number. For every number divisible by 5, it will say "Buzz." If a number happens to be divisible by both 3 and 5, it will say "FizzBuzz." I hope you enjoy this rendition of FizzBuzz!
